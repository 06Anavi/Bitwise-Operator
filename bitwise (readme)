Aim-
To demonstrate the use of bitwise operators in C++ and understand how they manipulate individual bits of integer values.

Theory-
Bitwise operators perform operations directly on the binary representation of integers. They are used for low-level programming, optimization, and tasks like setting, clearing, or toggling specific bits. The common bitwise operators include:

    AND (&): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.

    OR (|): Sets each bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1.

    XOR (^): Sets each bit to 1 if only one bit is 1 (exclusive or).

    NOT (~): Inverts all the bits.

    Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left, filling with zeros.

    Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right.

Example: For a = 5 (0101) and b = 9 (1001), a & b = 0001 which is 1.

Conclusion-
Bitwise operators provide a powerful way to manipulate individual bits of data efficiently. Understanding them is crucial in fields like embedded programming, cryptography, and performance optimization. The program above demonstrates the basic bitwise operations, showing how bits of integers are manipulated to produce various results.
